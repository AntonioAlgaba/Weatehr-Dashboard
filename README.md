# Weather-Dashboard

## User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Description
In this project I've created a weather app using the openweathermap API

The acceptance critera are:

- Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
   - When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
   - When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
   - The city name
   - The date
   - An icon representation of weather conditions
   - The temperature
   - The humidity
   - The wind speed
   
-When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
   - The date
   - An icon representation of weather conditions
   - The temperature
   - The humidity
   
 - When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
